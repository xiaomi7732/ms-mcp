| [VS Code Agent Mode Just Changed Everything](https://youtu.be/dutyOc_cAEU?t=19) | Ever wished your code editor could write your app, talk to your database, and even follow documentation like a real dev? In this video, we show you how to use agent mode, MCP Servers and PRD documents to build an entire app complete with database.|
| [The Future of AI in VS Code: MCP Servers Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp0p7iKH6ho) | In this video, we break down MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers and how they supercharge GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio Code. Learn how to set up and use MCP servers to bring live, real-time context—like web searches and databases—directly into your AI coding workflow. |
| [Build Remote MCP servers using Azure Functions in C# and .NET](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Build+Remote+MCP+servers+using+Azure+Functions+in+C%23+and+.NET) | Deploy MCP Servers with Azure Functions and .NET |
| [Build Remote MCP servers using Azure Functions in C# and TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Build+Remote+MCP+servers+using+Azure+Functions+in+C%23+and+TypeScript) | Deploy MCP Servers with Azure Functions and TypeScript |
| [Use APIs as tools for your Agents with MCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf5xxhT9ySs) | Learn how to use APIs as tools within your MCP agents |
| [This Protocol will Transform My Linux Lab](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=This+Protocol+will+Transform+My+Linux+Lab) | Cloud Engineer/Ops focused implementation of MCP |
| [Model context Protocol + Aspire = AI Magic in .NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2holzbob1_I&t=138s) | In this video, we walk you through how to integrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into a Blazor Chat Application powered by .NET Aspire using the official C# SDK. 🚀 The official C# SDK makes it easy to implement and interact with MCP clients and servers in your .NET apps. In this demo, we’ll see how to create a Blazor-based chat app, configure MCP, and connect it to a local AI model using Qwq — all managed by .NET Aspire! |
