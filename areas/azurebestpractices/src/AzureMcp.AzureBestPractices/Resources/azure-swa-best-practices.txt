When creating, deploying, or managing static web apps, make use of the Static Web Apps CLI.

## Handling Configuration Files

Do not create the staticwebapp.config.json or swa-cli.config.json files manually.
They will be created by the Static Web Apps CLI.

## Installing the Static Web Apps CLI

Install the Static Web Apps CLI using npm, if it hasn't been installed already:
```bash
npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli
```

## Initializing a Static Web App

When creating a new Static Web App, initialize it with the following command:
```bash
npx swa init --yes
```

Call this before creating any files.

## Building the Static Web App

To build the Static Web App, use the following command:
```bash
npx swa build
```

## Pre-deployment check
Check *.config.json file to make sure "appLocation" and "outputLocation" are not pointing to the same location. If they are, create a new folder under the root directory and update "outputLocation" to point to it.

## Deploying the Static Web App to Azure

To deploy the Static Web App, use the following command:
```bash
npx swa deploy --env production
```

This will deploy it to the "production" environment. Always confirm with the user before deploying the static web app.

When deployment succeeds the CLI will always return the URL of the deployed static web app. If it does not return a URL, then the deployment failed.
