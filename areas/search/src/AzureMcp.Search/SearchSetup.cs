        Search operations - Commands for Azure AI Search (formerly known as \"Azure Cognitive Search\") services and 
        search indexes. Use this tool when you need to list search services and indexes, get index details, or execute 
        queries against indexed content. This tool supports  enterprise search, document search, and knowledge mining 
        workloads. Do not use this tool for database queries, Azure Monitor log searches, general web search, or 
        simple string matching operations - this tool is specifically designed for Azure AI Search service management 
        and complex search operations. This tool is a hierarchical MCP command router where sub-commands are routed to 
        MCP servers that require specific fields inside the \"parameters\" object. To invoke a command, set 
        \"command\" and wrap its arguments in \"parameters\". Set \"learn=true\" to discover available sub-commands 
        for different search service and index operations. Note that this tool requires appropriate Azure AI Search 
        permissions and will only access search services and indexes accessible to the authenticated user.
